# My-Project-for-Python-for-Everybody
This is my first ever project in Python as well as other coding language

How It Works:
Data Retrieval:

Uses the disease.sh API to fetch live COVID-19 stats.

Processing:

Converts JSON data into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.

Visualization:

Plots bar charts for cases/deaths/recoveries.

User Interaction:

CLI menu lets users pick metrics to visualize.

Output Example:

Fetching latest COVID-19 data...

COVID-19 Data Analyzer
1. Show Top Countries by Cases
2. Show Top Countries by Deaths
3. Show Top Countries by Recovered
4. Exit
Select an option (1-4): 1

Why This Project Stands Out:

Real-world data: Uses a live API (not static files).

Professional tools: Pandas for data wrangling, matplotlib for visuals.

Scalable: Easy to add more metrics (e.g., vaccination rates).

Extensions (If You Want More):

Export to CSV:

python
df.to_csv("covid_data.csv", index=False)

Interactive Plots: Use Plotly instead of matplotlib.

Predictive Modeling: Add a trendline using numpy.

Let me know if you'd like to tweak this further! This is a portfolio-ready project that showcases your Python skills. ðŸš€
